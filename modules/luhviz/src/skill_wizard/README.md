# Skill Wizard
This module is just a wish - it has never been implemented since yet.

## Idea
The idea of this module is to deliver a simple to use Ui for defining and editing skills of the [skillsystem](../../../skills/README.md). 
For that a we want to use a simple node system which the user can choose predefined blocks which represent a step in a skill and than can arrange them with drag and drop. The blocks have parameters to configure their behaviour and they have inputs and outputs to which other nodes can be connected.
