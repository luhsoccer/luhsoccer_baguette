# Timeline
The timeline was started but is not finished yet as there were other more important tasks to do.

## Idea
The idea of this timeline was to create a component which internally records games in a buffer or in a file with all visual content (all markers) per timestamp. This component could than be used for game analysis and more, because one can stop the current game, watch situation in slow motion and much more. As mentioned this module is work in progress and maybe will never be finished.
